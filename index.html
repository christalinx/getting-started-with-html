<p><b>World Wide Web</b><br><br>
  The World Wide Web (WWW) consists basicaly of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) documents linked together by hyperlinks. 
  The WWW was invented in the early 1990s, nowadays there are about 30 billion web pages online on the web. 
  All type of files can be found on the web, besides HTML documents (that hold everything together), there are mainly videos, photos and music files online.</p>
<p><b>Major components of the web</b><br><br>
  The major pieces of the web are: (1) client computers with web browsers, (2) the "cloud" and (3) servers that host files. 
  Browsers make requests via the internet to servers using the HTTP protocol (Hypter Text Transfer Protocoll).
  The servers respond by files, transfered through the internet and displayed by browsers.</p>
<p><b>HTML</b><br><br>
  The heart of the web are HTML documents that hold everything together. HTML documents consists of text content, markups (how the content is formated or arranged) and of links (references to other pages or files, e.g multimedia files.
  Markups are made up of tags, normally in the following structure: < opening tag > content < /closing tag >. Tags can also be nested, where the content is another tag inside the tag. There are also void tags that only need opening tags but no closing tags.</p>
  <p>These are the most important basic HTML tags:</p>
  <p>bold tag: < b > content < /b> makes tagged content bold<br>
  emphasis tag: < em > content < /em> makes tagged content italic<br>
  link tag: < a href="wwww.udacity.com"> content< /a> which is an anchor tag, using the href attribute containing the url to link to.<br>
  image tag: < img src="www.xyz.com/123.jpeg" alt="alternate text"><br>
  line break tag: < br > adds a line break (it's a void tag)<br>
  paragraph tag: < p >content < /p> adds an invisible box around the paragraphed text</p>
  <p>Note about white space in HTML: mltiple white space within text is turned into one single white space.</p>
  <p>In HTML, there are different type of elements. Inline elements are used within a specific line of content, e.g. the < br > tag. 
  Block elements as the paragraph use an invisible box to define space around it. One other pair of an expample is the inline element of "< span> < /span>" opposed to the block element "< div > < /div> </p>
  <p>When forgetting to set a closing tag, then everything followed by the opening tag is formated by this opening tag.
  Programmers often say that computers are stupid in the sense that computers only understand clear and error-less instructions (commands) and react very sensitive to typing errors...</p>  
  <p>The structure of an HTML document is as follows:<br></p>  
    < !DOCTYPE HTML > <br>
    < HTML > <br>
    < HEAD > <br>
    < BODY > <br>
      tagged content <br>
    < /BODY> <br>  
    < /HEAD> <br>  
    < /HTML> <br>
  </p>
